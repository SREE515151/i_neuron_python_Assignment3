Here are a few:\n1.Functions make your code more modular and reusable, means that you can break your code up into smaller, more manageable pieces, and then reuse those pieces in other programs. This makes the code easier to read, understand, and maintain.\n2.Functions can help you to avoid duplication of code. \n3.Functions can help you to make your code more efficient and by defining a function to perform a specific task, you can avoid having to repeat the same code over and over again. This can make your code run faster and more efficiently.\n4.Functions can help you to improve the readability of your code.It can make it easier to debug your code and to fix problems.",
